# Usage: layout uv [<uv sync options>...]
#
# Enables the uv project layout in the current directory, and syncs
# the dependencies in the project. Any options you pass here will
# be forwarded to `uv sync`, after `--frozen`.
layout_uv() {
  # Watch the uv configuration file for changes
  watch_file .python-version pyproject.toml uv.lock

  # Use --frozen so that direnv entry does not change the lock contents. This
  # can fail if the lock file is badly out of sync, but it'll report that to the
  # user and the resolution is obvious.
  uv sync --frozen "$@" || true

  # activate the virtualenv after syncing; this puts the newly-installed
  # binaries on PATH.
  venv_path="$(expand_path "${UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT:-.venv}")"
  if [[ -e $venv_path ]]; then
    # shellcheck source=/dev/null
    source "$venv_path/bin/activate"
